Dcrctl is a command-line client for interacting with the JSON-RPC servers of
[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) and
[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet).

## Usage

In its default configuration, dcrctl connects to dcrd's mainnet RPC port on
localhost.  The `--wallet` and `--testnet` flags change these defaults to the
dcrwallet RPC port and/or testnet ports.  The `--rpcserver/-s` flag can be used
to specify other hostnames or IP addresses of the server, and can also be used
to override the port defaults.

Dcrctl will attempt to read dcrd and dcrwallet config files for the
user/password authentication.  If these fields cannot be read, dcrctl must be
manually configured with the correct authentication.  Permanent configuration
changes may be written to a config file in a platform-specific location:

* macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Dcrctl/dcrctl.conf`
* Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Dcrctl\dcrctl.conf`
* Linux and other Unix: `~/.dcrctl/dcrctl.conf`

## Build and installation

- **Install Go 1.19 or higher version**

  Installation instructions can be found here: https://golang.org/doc/install.
  Ensure Go was installed properly and is a supported version:
  ```sh
  $ go version
  $ go env GOROOT GOPATH
  ```
  NOTE: if `GOROOT` and `GOPATH` are initialized they must not be on the same path.
  It is recommended to add `$GOPATH/bin` to your `PATH` according to the Golang.org
  instructions.

- **Build or Update dcrctl**

  The latest release of dcrctl may be built in a single command without cloning
  this repository:

  ```sh
  $ go install decred.org/dcrctl@release-v1.8.0
  ```

  Using `@master` instead will perform a release build using the latest code
  from the master branch.  This may be useful to execute RPC methods not yet
  found in the latest Decred release:

  ```sh
  $ go install decred.org/dcrctl@master
  ```

  Alternatively, a development build can be performed by running `go install` in
  a locally checked-out repository.

  If you want to easily access `dcrctl` from the command-line without having to
  type the full path to the binary every time, ensure the bin directory rooted
  at the path reported by `go env GOPATH` is added to your system path:

  * Windows: [how to add binary to your PATH](https://gist.github.com/nex3/c395b2f8fd4b02068be37c961301caa7#windows)
  * Linux and other Unix: [how to add binary to your PATH](https://gist.github.com/nex3/c395b2f8fd4b02068be37c961301caa7#linux)

## Developing

When developing either the `dcrd` or `dcrwallet` RPC servers and making
modifications to the RPC methods, you may want to build a development version of
`dcrctl` supporting these changes.  Due to `dcrctl` being built around
package-global method registrations and reflection, supporting these changes
only requires building with the updated packages.

This can be easily achieved by making use of a local Go workspace that uses the
development versions of `dcrd` and `dcrwallet` as follows:

```
$ go work init .
$ go work use ../dcrd/rpc/jsonrpc/types ../dcrwallet
```
